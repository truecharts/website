After building our own MetalLB, CNPG and Prometheus operator charts, we've also now finished the work on building our own Cert-Manager operator chart. As of today this chart will be a requirement for new users if they want to use Cert-Manager and required for all users starting August 1, 2023.

If you have already installed clusterissuer follow the below guidance for installation of the Cert-Manager operator chart.

If you have not already done so add the operator train to TrueCharts [as outlined here](https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started#adding-truecharts)

1. Run this in the system shell as **root**: <br />
```k3s kubectl delete  --grace-period 30 --v=4 -k https://github.com/truecharts/manifests/delete4```
2. Install [cert-manager](https://truecharts.org/charts/operators/cert-manager/) from the operators train.
3. Update [clusterissuer](https://truecharts.org/charts/enterprise/clusterissuer/) to the latest version of (2.0.1+).

- If you are already on the latest version perform an empty edit of clusterissuer (Edit app and save without making any changes).

*If you run into additional issues, please file a ticket with our dedicated support staff via the **#support** channel of our [discord](https://discord.gg/tVsPTHWTtr) as normal.*
