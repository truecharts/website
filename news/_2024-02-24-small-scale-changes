There have been some minor changes to how some things are done on SCALE.
None of them will require a reinstall and the migration steps are not going to cause any likely breakage.

## Nextcloud

Nextcloud is moved to the enterprise train.
To migrate from `stable` to `enterprise` train versions, run the following command in SCALE terminal:
`k3s kubectl patch ns ix-nextcloud -p '{"metadata":{"labels":{"catalog_train":"enterprise"}}}'`

If not using the `root` user, please prefix this with `sudo`

## GPUs

We've decided to remove the SCALE-specific way of handling GPU loading, in favor of the "normal" wat its done in kubernetes.
One of the reasons why we've decided to do this, is the fact that the language used by iX-Systems is very confusing for the user and adding their custom middleware on-top of normal kubernetes makes it less reliable.

In short this means you will have to specify the number of GPU's to assign to an App under `resources` then `limits` and your specific GPU type.
(either AMD, NVIDIA or Intel).

From an end-user perspective it's just moved to a slightly different place and instead of a drop-down you'll have to enter a number of GPU's to assign, `1` in most cases.

## Pre-DragonFish Storage

To make it easier to migrate to DragonFish, all users are adviced to set any-and-all references to "StorageClass" to `SCALE-ZFS` for any existing charts/apps.
This ensures those charts/apps stay working after migrating to TrueNAS SCALE DragonFish in the future.

If you do not do this, we cannot guarantee your data stays in tact when you move to DragonFish in the future.
