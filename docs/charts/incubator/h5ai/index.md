h5ai is a modern file indexer for HTTP web servers with focus on your files. Directories are displayed in a appealing way and browsing them is enhanced by different views, a breadcrumb and a tree overview. Initially h5ai was an acronym for HTML5 Apache Index but now it supports other web servers too.
