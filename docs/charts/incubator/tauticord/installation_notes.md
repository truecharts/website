:::note Common Issues

- On startup, Tauticord attempts to upload a set of custom emojis that it will use when displaying stream information ( if they do not already exist). Your bot will need to have the Manage Emojis permission in order to do this.
- Discord has a limit of 50 custom emojis per server. If you have reached this limit, you will need to remove some of your existing emojis before Tauticord can upload its own.
- If you do not want to remove any of your existing emojis, Tauticord will simply skip uploading its own emojis and use the default emojis that Discord provides instead.
