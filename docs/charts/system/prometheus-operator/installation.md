you should follow instructions from the [FAQ](https://truecharts.org/manual/FAQ#prometheus-operator) to resolve it

### Helm

On Helm this indicates your previously had a non-TrueCharts version of Prometheus-Operator installed.
Please uninstall all old CRD's before installing our version of Prometheus Operator.

If you don't know how, this might be a good moment to do some research or ask yourself if running DIY clusters is a good idea for your specific knowlage level.
