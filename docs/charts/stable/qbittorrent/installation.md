## Dataset Structure

This is the location your completed bittorrent files will be located

Setting user:group to `apps`.

:::note

The `apps`:`apps` user:group is built into Truenas SCALE, it is the default user for most applications on Truenas SCALE.
You do not have to create a separate user for each application.

When configuring your application you'll typically see user:group `568`, this is the UID for `apps` and its recommended not to change it.

## App Installation

### Networking

If you want to use ingress, its probably better to use `clusterIP` instead of `LoadBalancer`

![!Networking: qbittorrent](./img/networking.png)

#### WebGUI

We left this default since there was no reason to change the WebGUI port

This is ALSO the port Sonarr/Radarr and other services will use to connect to qBittorrent

![!Networking: qbittorrent](./img/networking_webgui.png)

#### Listening Ports

:::tip VPN "With VPN"

- No need to port forward on your router
- If you want fast seeding, you will need a service that supports port forwarding and set the TCP Listening Port to the port Desired
- Mullvad for example, from Qbit Webui, Tools > Options > Connection tab. Set TCP Listening port to the Port Provided by Mullvad.

:::

:::tip NOVPN "Without VPN"

- You can leave the two ports default without a VPN
- If you want fast seeding though, you will need to port forward this port on your router

### Connection

This should equal to your listening port you set [during the installation](https://heavysetup.info/applications/qbittorrent/installation/#listening-ports)

![!Connection: qbit](./img/settings_connection.png)

<br />

### Speed

- Set `Alternative Rate Limits` to `10000` KiB
  - This is so during the day, or when users are using my Plex server, my qBittorrent instance isn't using _ALL_ of my bandwidth seeding
- Set my schedule from `08:00` to `02:00`
  - 8am to 2am, which is around the time users are watching Plex

![!Speed: qbit](./img/settings_speed.png)

<br />

### BitTorrent

- Disabled `Local Peer Discovery`
  - This is only useful if you are on a huge network, like a college campus or something like that

![!Speed: qbit](./img/settings_bittorrent.png)

<br />

### WebGUI

- Changed the password to something We would remember

Added both my LAN and Kubernetes LAN to the bypass list, this way neither of them have to authenticate, it gets annoying to log in over and over on your own network

**Bypass authentication for clients in whitelisted IP subnets**

- `192.168.0.0/16`
- `172.16.0.0/16`

![!Speed: qbit](./img/settings_webgui1.png)

Since We am using `Traefik`, We decided to add the Kubernetes LAN to:

**Enable reverse proxy support**

- `172.16.0.0/16`
