A utility to "burn-in" a new disk, before adding it to your array has been requested several times.  Also requested is a process to "pre-clear" a hard disk before adding it to your array.  When a special "signature" is detected, the lengthy "clearing" step otherwise performed by TrueNAS is skipped.
