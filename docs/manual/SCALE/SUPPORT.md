::: warning Support Guidelines

Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tVsPTHWTtr) support (the ticketing system inside #support) is primarily limited to what is covered by our written guides. This includes installing, linking and editing apps. This doesn't mean the actual setup of the application. All #support tickets covered by the staff are done so in a **best effort** policy.
