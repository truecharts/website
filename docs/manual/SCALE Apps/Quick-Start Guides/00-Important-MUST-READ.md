# 00 - IMPORTANT: Must Read!

All guides under this section are made for TrueNAS SCALE.
We do **NOT** control anything made by iX-Systems, no mater how great or shitty it is.

More specifically we have no control **AT ALL** about the following:

- Adding/Creating certificates
- Backups
- Restore
- Rollback
- Opening the Shell
- All GUI elements except: Install-menu, Edit-menu and Portal-Button

Even if we made some tools and guides to make the above easier to use, we cannot provide **any** support for these features.

More specifically:
Anything related to TrueTool, is considered a "stop gap"-measure, to cover for inherent lacking functionality on TrueNAS SCALE.
We understand some things are shit, but we do not have the manpower to go into endless support and feedback loops about those features.
