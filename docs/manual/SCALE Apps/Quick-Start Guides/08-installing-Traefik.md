# 08 - Installing Traefik

Within TrueCharts our aim is to make it as easy as possible to secure your Apps. To support this we supply a separate Traefik "ingress" app, which has been pre-configured to provide secure and fast connections.

## Reminder

Traefik is part of the `stable` train, so make sure you have it enabled as specified in [Step 1](https://truecharts.org/manual/Quick-Start%20Guides/01-Adding-TrueCharts/) of our Quick Start Guides
