# Unit tests

We unit test our common library, while it isn't near complete coverage but it does offer some basic checks.

## Running the tests

Running these tests can be done any way you like. In this document we limit ourselves to using Visual Studio Code, using our Development Container.

### Using Visual Studio Code

Our repo comes with a Visual Studio Code [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) definition and `launch.json` that allow you to quickly set up an environment in which you can run the tests.

#### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code is installed.
- Docker is installed and running.
- The "Remote - Containers" extension is installed and enabled in Visual Studio Code.

For more details, please refer to the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_system-requirements).

#### Running tests

Once Visual Studio Code is set up, and you open the `charts` workspace, you will see a popup asking if you wish to re-open the workspace in a development container:

![Visual Studio Code development container popup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k8s-at-home/charts/master/docs/images/vscode_devcontainer_popup.png)

Select to do so and a Dockerized workspace will be built. You can now use Visual Studio Code as normal.

To run or debug the unit tests, click the "Run" button on the left sidebar and select the desired configuration:

![Visual Studio Code run configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k8s-at-home/charts/master/docs/images/vscode_run_unittests.png)

- _UnitTest - active spec file only_: This configuration will try to run the currently opened test file.

  **Note:** Make sure that you have opened a valid test file (`.rb` files in the `test/charts` folder), or this will not work.

- _UnitTest - all spec files_: This configuration will run the all test files in the `test/charts` folder.

Next, press the green "Play" icon. This will start the tests show the outcome in a terminal window.

## Output

A successful test will output something like the following...
