:::warning Support Guidelines

Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tVsPTHWTtr) support (the ticketing system inside #support) is primarily limited to what is covered by our written guides. This includes installing, linking and editing apps. This doesn't mean the actual setup of the application. All #support tickets covered by the staff are done so in a **best effort** policy.

:::

## Stable Train Charts

We provide direct support for getting `stable` train charts working on our [discord](https://discord.gg/tVsPTHWTtr) inside the **#support** channel.
That includes installation and guidance on getting it working with defaults or basic settings (not advanced customizations or remote smb shares, etc).
Bug reports aren't accepted on [discord](https://discord.gg/tVsPTHWTtr) so if you spot a bug (Charts in the stable train should work with mostly defaults configuration)
please report them to our [github](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/new/choose). Bug reports that state something doesn't work without supporting items may be closed.

## Incubator Train Charts

Our support policy for `incubator` train charts is different for those on the `stable` train. Those charts are work in progress,
may break at anytime and we're still going through many of the charts from unRAID. We won't accept support tickets for `incubator` train
charts on our [discord](https://discord.gg/tVsPTHWTtr). However, we have an **#incubator-chat** channel for these apps to help get them running and/or receive feedback.
With enough positive feedback a chart can be promoted to `stable` train. Feedback about bugs is also accepted there which can be used to fix them.
Assume anything in the `incubator` train is in beta and you're testing it. As well, anything installed in `incubator` will have to be REINSTALLED once it moves to the `stable` train.
