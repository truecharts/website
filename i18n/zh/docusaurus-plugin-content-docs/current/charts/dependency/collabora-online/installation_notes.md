# Installation Notes

If you don't enable `Reverse Proxy` on `Collabora` (It's not recommended as it is unsecure), in order for it to work you have to

* Remove `-o:ssl.termination=true -o:ssl.enable=false` from `Extra Parameters`.
* Set `Server Name` to `hostIP:port` (The port number you set for `NodePort`)
* Set `Service type` to `NodePort`
* Set `Port type` to `HTTPS`
* Disable certificate validation in the app you are going to use it. (eg. Nextcloud have a checkbox under Collabora's URL to disable Cert Validation)
