# Storage

This article serves as a development extension to the storage article available [here](https://wiki.truecharts.org/general/storage/)

## Storage and Common-Chart

For all these storage solutions we require the common-chart to be added to the App. The Common-Chart handles both the connection/addition of storage to the container and spinning up special k8s jobs to fix the permissions if requested for the Custom storage.

### Integrated Persistent Storage

When adding an App, there are almost always certain folders that are required for solid Apps performance. For example config files that should be persistent across restarts.

For these storages we can easily add fixes values in the UI, these settings can not be disabled or removed and would, by default and preferably, be limited to the "internal" storage class Preventing the user to disable them, ensures that users don't (by mistake) remove the storage.

### Unlimited Custom Storage Mounts

We support presenting the user with a "Do it yourself" style list, in which the user can add unlimited paths on the host system to mount. It should always be included in any App, to give users the option to customize things however they like.
