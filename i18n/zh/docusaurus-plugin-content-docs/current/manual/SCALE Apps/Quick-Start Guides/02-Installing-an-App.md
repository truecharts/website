# 02 - Installing Apps

Here we will go over a basic install of Plex, to showcase how you can install a TrueNAS SCALE App from the TrueCharts Catalog with mostly default settings

## B. 所需经费

- Make sure your storage-pool is created and working
- Make sure you have a working internet connection and can reach github and truecharts.org from the host system.
- Make sure you already added the TrueCharts catalog from `Step 01 - Adding TrueCharts to SCALE`

### Adding the App

- Go to `Available Applications`
- Click the `Install` button next to the App you want to install
- on step 01 give your App a name
- Unless you need to change something, for example the allowed networks for Plex, you can ignore steps and just click `Next`
- On the last step, review any changes you made to the defaults in the summary
- Click `Submit` to install your App of choice
- Under `Installed applications` you will see a new tile with the name of your App
- Wait a few minutes until the App is started, a `Portal` button will appear that takes you to the GUI of your App of choice
