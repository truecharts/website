# Sponsors Us

## Sponsorship

As a project we try to maintain strict independence and financial ethics, this means we actively disclose if we receive any funds for any kind of promotion or attention.

However: We are always open to promoting great projects and those projects are free to donate to us as a "thank you", regardless of donations/contributions.

## Donations

As we have no formal legal entity, we can only accept donations on a personal basis.
