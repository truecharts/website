## Important Changes

With upcomming "Electric Eel" version of TrueNAS SCALE, iX-Systems has decided to completely gut the kubernetes backend and screw over its community.
However, we got you covered so you can safely keep running your TrueCharts Charts... On "TalosOS", A dedicated unmutable kubernetes OS that has been rock-solid for years!

We'll be using a TalosOS VM on TrueNAS SCALE, but any solid hypervisor would suffice.
As a storage backend, we will be using Democratic CSI to automatically use your already-existing TrueNAS storage server to store all your data.

There are multiple steps to this process:

- Preparing your network
- Creating the VM
- Installing Talos OS
- Bootstrapping a basic cluster
- Migrating your SCALE Apps to TalosOS

## Preparing your network

### Creating a bridge

For communication with the TrueNAS host system, it's important that you create a "bridge" network interface first


## Creating the VM

### Creating the storage zvol

### Downloading the TalosOS ISO

### Creating the Virtual machine

## Installing Talos OS

## Bootstrapping a basic cluster
## Migating your SCALE Apps to TalosOS

### Exporting your Apps

### Modifying your exports

### Importing your Charts
