title: Cobia to DragonFish Storage Migration
---

:::caution[Execute all steps at once]

It's imperative to execute **ALL** steps in this guide in one sitting. If you reboot or take any time away from this task, we cannot guarantee your data and apps stay working.
Please only continue when you have time available to complete the migration.

It's also important to note that the migration to DragonFish **requires** reinstallation of all Apps. For which an automated solution is available in the guide as well.
Please read this migration guide carefully _before_ upgrading to DragonFish.
:::

## Important Changes

iX-Systems no longer maintains or supports any form of PVC-based storage for apps. This includes their own "legacy" storage backend. This means that when using the following SCALE features, you will lose some functionality:

- **SCALE Backup and Restore (unreleased feature available through HeavyScript)** - Will no longer back up PVC storage at all.

- **SCALE App Rollback** - You will no longer be able to roll back any PVC storage

- **SCALE App Pool Migration** - You will no longer be able to migrate PVC storage using the pool migration feature in SCALE.

The above issues exist both for our new in-house TrueCharts OpenEBS storage solution **and** for users using already installed apps that use the legacy storage backend from iX-Systems.

## For Existing Users and Apps

:::note[Ensure apps are up-to-date on Cobia]
Prior to updating to TrueNAS SCALE DragonFish, please ensure all of your TrueCharts apps are fully up-to-date and working correctly.

### Post Cobia-to-DragonFish Upgrade Steps

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Wait at least 30 minutes after Cobia-to-Dragonfish upgrade

    Once you have completed updating your TrueNAS SCALE system from Cobia to DragonFish, the first step is to **wait at least 30 minutes after updating and the SCALE WebUI becomes accessible**. This allows time for the update to finish and services to be started. Do not restart the system or otherwise interrupt its operation during this time.

2. Clean up the System

    We now need to clean up some old Cobia objects. Enter the following command in the TrueNAS SCALE shell as root:

    _Replace `TANK` in the command with your pool name that contains the ix-applications dataset_

    ```shell title="Remove Old OpenEBS"
    rm /mnt/TANK/ix-applications/k3s/server/manifests/zfs-operator.yaml && sudo k3s kubectl delete -f https://truecharts.org/openebsrem.yaml && sudo k3s kubectl delete storageClass openebs-zfspv-default
    ```

3. Create Dataset for PVCs and Install OpenEBS

    Continue with the OpenEBS setup section of our TrueNAS SCALE Getting Started [Guide](/scale/guides/getting-started#openebs-setup) and once complete, proceed to next step.

4. Migrate Apps to New Storage using TT-Migration Script

    Thanks to great collaboration with HeavyBullets, the TT-Migration tool will automate most of the migration process for existing apps:
    https://github.com/Heavybullets8/TT-Migration

    - Existing apps with PVCs or databases should be reinstalled using the TT-Migration script.
    - System train apps (`cloudnative-pg`, `cert-manager`, etc.) **should _NOT_ be reinstalled**. You will see a warning in the script if you attempt to migrate a system train app.
    - Apps without PVC storage do _NOT_ need to be reinstalled. You will see a notice in the script if you attempt to migrate an app with no PVCs.

    Running the below command in the TrueNAS SCALE shell will (1) clone/download Heavy's TT-Migration repo to your SCALE system, (2) enter the path for it and (3) execute the migration script as root:

    ```shell title="Install and Run TT-Migration"
    git clone https://github.com/Heavybullets8/TT-Migration.git && cd TT-Migration && sudo bash migrate.sh
    ```

    If you want to see the steps that it performs, or if you'd like to perform the steps yourself manually using the guide, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Heavybullets8/TT-Migration?tab=readme-ov-file#guide).
