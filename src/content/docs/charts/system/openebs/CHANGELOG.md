### Chore



- rework SCALE catagories/groups to match helm and remove deprecated charts ([#21111](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/21111))

### Feat

### Chore



- rework SCALE catagories/groups to match helm and remove deprecated charts ([#21111](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/21111))

### Feat



- BREAKING CHANGE make it an umbrella chart with multiple upstream dependencies ([#19813](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/19813))

- BREAKING CHANGE (on scale) use zfs backend instead of localpath on scale ([#19548](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/19548))

### Chore



- rework SCALE catagories/groups to match helm and remove deprecated charts ([#21111](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/21111))

### Feat



- BREAKING CHANGE make it an umbrella chart with multiple upstream dependencies ([#19813](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/19813))

- BREAKING CHANGE (on scale) use zfs backend instead of localpath on scale ([#19548](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/issues/19548))
