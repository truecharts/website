### Chart Specific Guides and information

All our charts have dedicated documentation pages.
The documentation for this chart can be found here:
https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/esphome

### Configuration Options

Please note: For TrueNAS SCALE, only options available in the GUI are supported.
Hence most of these docs do not apply to TrueNAS SCALE

To view the chart specific options, please view Values.yaml included in the chart.
The most recent version of which, is available here: https://github.com/truecharts/charts/charts/stable/esphome/values.yaml

All our Charts use a shared "common" library chart that contains most of the templating and options.
