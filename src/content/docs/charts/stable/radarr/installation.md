## App Installation

### Networking

If you are wanting to use ingress, its probably better to use clusterIP instead

- We changed the UDP and TCP port to match the Mullvad ports allocated, your VPN provider might require something else

<br />

### Storage

#### Configuration

The setup is default

![!Storage: NZBGet](./img/storage_config.png)

<br />

#### Media - Destination Folders

- Media is so that Radarr will have a location to place files once they're completed
- This will be the folder Radarr places files for plex to then parse through.

![!Storage: NZBGet](./img/storage_data_media.png)

<br />

#### Backups

- '/config/Backups' is the location Radarr places its automatic and manual backups
- We created a separate dataset meant for backups, specifically to have an easy way to restore a backup, in the event the application is wrongly deleted, or removed, corrupt, whatever

![!Storage: NZBGet](./img/storage_data_backups.png)

<br />

#### NZB

- This is obviously the location Radarr will look for completed NZB files
- Its also the location NZBGet saves its completed movie files

![!Storage: NZBGet](./img/storage_data_nzb.png)

<br />

#### Bittorrent

- This is the location Radarr will look for completed qBittorrent files
- Its also the location qBittorrent saves its completed movie files

![!Storage: NZBGet](./img/storage_data_qbit.png)

<br />

#### Syncthing

- This is the location Radarr will look for completed Syncthing files
- Its also the location Syncthing saves its completed movie files

![!Storage: NZBGet](./img/storage_data_syncthing.png)

<br />

## In-App Configuration

For Radarr, We specifically just follow the [TRaSH Guides for Radarr](https://trash-guides.info/Radarr/) setup.

- It clearly details how to setup custom profiles to ensure you are grabbing the latest and greatest media. We have been using it for months now and have not had an issue.

<br />

Thank Goodness for IBRACORP, We thought We would have to make a video myself covering this topic. However, it seems they got most of everything We would have covered.

## qbittorrent Integration

### Mountpoints

Its important to keep your mountpoints for each of the applications the same. Otherwise you will need to setup a `remote path`

- They may be slightly different, but as long as they have the same root directory it will be fine.

<br />

#### Radarrs Storage Settings

I set it to a sub directory of `/qbitvpn` though since `/qbitvpn/complete/movies` is the only directory Radarr needs to see, since it only needs to see movies that are completed
