TrueCharts has multiple "trains", or branches of charts which you can choose to install. Below is a summary of each train and its intended use.

- `stable` contains apps which have been thoroughly tested and expected to be stable and working. The `stable` version of an app is always the best available version
- `incubator` contains apps which are still in development and/or are not considered to be stable and working well enough to be moved into the `stable` branch
- `premium` contains apps for core TrueCharts features and, in the future, will be covered by additional support for professional use cases
- `system` contains operators required for certain apps apps to function at all, recommended leaving this `enabled`.

[See here](/charts/description-list) for a list of all apps available for each TrueCharts trains.
