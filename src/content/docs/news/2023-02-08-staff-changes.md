TrueCharts is proud to announce some exciting changes to our core team in light of our rapidly growing project. With the growing needs of our community, we have decided to switch positions for two of our team members, @JagrBombs (Steven) and @mintyCrackers.

@mintyCrackers will now take on the role of Community Manager, where they will be responsible for fostering a positive and productive environment for our users. Meanwhile, @JagrBombs (Steven) will now serve as Head Moderator, bringing their technical expertise to the forefront of our moderation efforts.

In addition to these changes, we are thrilled to welcome a new member to our core team, XStar aka "The Noob". XStar will be joining us as Support Manager and will also be the maintainer of the Incubator train.

With these changes, we are confident that we can take TrueCharts beyond even our wildest dreams. We believe that these additions will not only bring fresh perspectives and new ideas, but also help us better serve and support our community.

Thank you for your continued support of TrueCharts, and stay tuned for more exciting updates in the future!
