We are excited to announce that the TrueCharts project has undergone a makeover with a fresh new look! Our team has been working hard behind the scenes to bring you a new logo, logo animations, and headers is clean, modern, and easily recognizable, making it a perfect representation of what TrueCharts is all about.

We've also created logo animations that bring our new logo to life. These new logo animations will help us stand out and make a lasting impression on our audience.

In addition to the new look, we're thrilled to announce that we've launched our official merch store on Etsy!

By purchasing from our merch store, you're not only getting a cool piece of TrueCharts swag, but you're also supporting our project. Every purchase helps us continue to develop and improve our platform, making it the best Helm and App repository out there!

We're very excited about the new look and the launch of our merch store, and we hope you are too. Stay tuned for more exciting news and updates from the TrueCharts project, as we continue to grow and evolve!
