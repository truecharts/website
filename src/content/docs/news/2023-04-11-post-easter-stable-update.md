Hope everyone had an amazing easter, we know we had a busy one to say the least!

We are excited to announce that we have completed porting the first 222 charts in our "stable" train to our new "common" library chart. This chart serves as the basis for all of our apps and charts, and we believe that it will provide a more stable and reliable foundation for all of our future work.

While there are still over 160 charts left to be ported in our stable train, we expect to complete this work before the end of the month. To ensure that we have sufficient time to complete this work, we are extending our code freeze for the stable train until May 1, 2023. After this date, we guarantee that we will resume our normal update schedule.

In addition, we want to make it clear that we have lifted the code freeze for our "Enterprise" and "Dependency" charts, and will continue to provide updates for these charts on a regular basis.

It is important to note that this update is considered "most likely breaking," and will likely wipe all databases used in charts. We also anticipate that there may be some regressions, which is why we encourage users to file bug reports or contact our support staff if they experience any issues.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank our community for their patience and understanding as we work to improve our platform. We believe that these updates will provide significant benefits in terms of stability, reliability, and functionality, and we look forward to sharing them with our users in the coming weeks and months.

As always, we welcome any feedback or suggestions from our users, and we remain committed to providing the best possible experience for everyone who uses our platform. Thank you again for your support, and we look forward to continuing to work with you in the future.
