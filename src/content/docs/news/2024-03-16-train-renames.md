We're back with some thrilling announcements that promise to enhance your experience with our platform. From revamped train names to key team appointments and even experimental support for TrueNAS SCALE 24.04 DragonFish, there's a lot to unpack. Let's dive right in!

## Train Name Refresh: Introducing Premium and System Trains

First off, we're thrilled to introduce our revamped train names: Premium Train and System Train. Say goodbye to the old names; these new labels better align with the quality and breadth of resources you'll find within.
You'll find both an automated script _and_ a one-by-one version to deal with this name change for you, for both SCALE and Helm platforms, at the [bottom](#note-automated-migration-script-for-train-name-changes) of this article.

### Enterprise out, Premium in

This change reflects the fact that this train no longer specifically targets enterprise customers, but in general stands for higher-quality charts.

### Hello, Operator? No, this is System

This name change reflects this train no longer just containing operators, but now also includes additional important system charts.

## Experimental Support for TrueNAS SCALE 24.04 DragonFish

In a bold move, we've added initial prototype support for TrueNAS SCALE 24.04 DragonFish. However, it's crucial to note that this support is still highly experimental. As such, we do not offer staff support or guarantee data integrity for the BETA or TC versions of TrueNAS SCALE 24.04 DragonFish.

## Note: Automated Migration Script for train name changes

To ensure a seamless transition to the new train names, we've developed a script that automates the process across all relevant namespaces. Here's the code!
Please be aware we do not give guarantees and this script may need adapting to your environment and/or additional permissions.

### Helm Platform - Automated Migration Script

_save as nameupdate.sh and run `chmod +x nameupdate.sh` before running it_

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Loop through all namespaces prefixed by "ix-"
for ns in $(kubectl get namespaces -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | grep '^ix-'); do
    # Check if the namespace has "catalog_train" label set to "enterprise" or "operators"
    catalog_train_label=$(kubectl get namespace "$ns" -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.catalog_train}')
    if [[ "$catalog_train_label" == "enterprise" ]]; then
        # Patch the namespace to change the "catalog_train" label to "premium"
        kubectl patch namespace "$ns" -p '{"metadata":{"labels":{"catalog_train":"premium"}}}'
        echo "Namespace $ns updated from enterprise to premium."
    elif [[ "$catalog_train_label" == "operators" ]]; then
        # Patch the namespace to change the "catalog_train" label to "system"
        kubectl patch namespace "$ns" -p '{"metadata":{"labels":{"catalog_train":"system"}}}'
        echo "Namespace $ns updated from operators to system."
    fi
done

```

### SCALE Platform - Automated Bash Shell Migration Script

_simply copy-paste this into the shell of your TrueNAS SCALE GUI_

```bash

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xstar97/scale-scripts/main/scripts/patchTCTrains.sh | bash --

```

### SCALE Platform - Automated Migration Script

_save as nameupdate.sh and run `chmod +x nameupdate.sh` before running it_

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Loop through all namespaces prefixed by "ix-"
for ns in $(k3s kubectl get ns --no-headers | grep "^ix-" | awk '{print $1}' ORS=' '); do
    # Check if the namespace has "catalog_train" label set to "enterprise" or "operators"
    catalog_train_label=$(k3s kubectl get namespace "$ns" -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.catalog_train}')
    if [[ "$catalog_train_label" == "enterprise" ]]; then
        # Patch the namespace to change the "catalog_train" label to "premium"
        k3s kubectl patch namespace "$ns" -p '{"metadata":{"labels":{"catalog_train":"premium"}}}'
        echo "Namespace $ns updated from enterprise to premium."
    elif [[ "$catalog_train_label" == "operators" ]]; then
        # Patch the namespace to change the "catalog_train" label to "system"
        k3s kubectl patch namespace "$ns" -p '{"metadata":{"labels":{"catalog_train":"system"}}}'
        echo "Namespace $ns updated from operators to system."
    fi
done

```

### Manual Migration Script

_Use this script to manually migrate your existing SCALE apps to the new trains. Replace `blocky` with the app name in question and `premium` with the new train-name_.

```bash
k3s kubectl patch ns ix-blocky -p '{"metadata":{"labels":{"catalog_train":"premium"}}}'
```
