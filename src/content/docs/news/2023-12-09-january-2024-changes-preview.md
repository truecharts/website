As we bid farewell to 2023, we're thrilled to share a sneak peek into the future of TrueCharts. January 2024 will mark a significant milestone for us as we unveil a host of groundbreaking changes and new features that will elevate your experience with our charts.

Here's a glimpse of what's in store:

## Improved CloudNative-PG Support

TrueCharts is committed to enhancing your experience with CloudNative-PG. Our upcoming release will bring improvements to ensure seamless integration and optimal performance.

## Prototype for CNPG Backups

Data security is a top priority for us. We are introducing a prototype for CloudNative-PG backups to provide you with robust and reliable data protection solutions.

## Completely Rewritten Ingress Backend

Our team has reimagined and rewritten the entire ingress backend to offer enhanced functionality, improved performance, and a more intuitive user experience.

## Homepage Integration for All Ingresses

As part of our commitment to accessibility, we're introducing [homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/) app integration for all ingresses. This integration will streamline navigation and make TrueCharts even more user-friendly. [homepage](https://gethomepage.dev) is a modern, fully static, fast, secure fully proxied, highly customizable application dashboard with integrations for over 100 services and translations into multiple languages.

## New Options for iSCSI, SMB, and NFS Storage Backend

Diversify your storage options with new features for iSCSI, SMB, and NFS storage backends. TrueCharts is expanding possibilities to cater to a broader range of user preferences and requirements.

# What do these changes mean for our current configurations

## Seamless Transition for CloudNative-PG Users

For users who haven't made modifications to their CloudNative-PG configuration, there's good news. You won't need to adapt your configuration in the GUI or values.yaml, ensuring a smooth transition to the latest version of TrueCharts implementation of CNPG.

## Ingress Value Restructuring

Certain changes to ingress values will be introduced. Detailed information about these changes will be published around the time of the release. We appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work to streamline and optimize our systems.

# Stay Up-to-Date for a Smoother Upgrade

To ensure a seamless transition to the next major step in TrueCharts, we strongly advise all users to ensure they are up-to-date before January 1, 2024. This proactive measure should pave the way for a smooth upgrade and prevent reinstallation of certain charts.

## Disclaimer

**Important Warning**: While we work hard to ensure a smooth transition, we cannot guarantee it. Some users might have to reinstall some charts. However, we are confident that this will be an extremely small minority.

The TrueCharts community has been a driving force behind our growth, and we're excited to embark on this journey with you. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to ushering in a new era of TrueCharts together.

Stay tuned for more updates and details as we approach the release date!

Best regards and happy holidays,

The TrueCharts Team
