Happy 2023 everyone!
We hope you had a great holiday season and are ready for a productive and successful 2023. As we start the new year, we wanted to announce that we have dropped support for TrueNAS SCALE 22.02 "Angelfish" completely and will only support TrueNAS SCALE 22.12 "BlueFin" moving forward.

Looking back at the past year, we are thrilled to see the tremendous growth of the TrueCharts project. In 2022, our Discord community grew from barely 1000 members to over 5200, and our project donations increased from just 50 euros a month to more than 250 euros a month. We also saw a significant increase in Github stars and the number of apps we offer.

As we look ahead to 2023, we have big plans for the TrueCharts project. Our goal is to reach 10,000 Discord members and offer 1000 apps by the end of the year. We also hope to increase our project donations to 500 euros per month and use these funds more proactively by offering bounties for much-wanted work on the project. Additionally, we will be putting more time and effort into (video) documentation and have almost completed a full refactor of our Common Chart.

Overall, we are excited for the opportunities and potential that 2023 holds for the TrueCharts project. Thank you for your continued support and we can't wait to see what the new year brings.
