As 2023 comes to a close, we're excited to introduce TrueAI, our new support AI for TrueCharts, TrueNAS, and HeavyScript users. This is our way of stepping into 2024 with a focus on enhancing user support through technology.

TrueAI is now available on our Discord server for everyone to use. To interact with the bot, simply mention @TrueAI in your message. The bot is programmed to create a thread in the channel where it's mentioned, or reply within an existing thread.

**Here are some tips for interacting with TrueAI:**

- Indicate whether you're using TrueNAS or HELM, and mention the version you're using.
- Clearly describe what you're trying to achieve.
- Mention any specific issues you're facing.
- If applicable, include any error messages you've encountered.

Please note that TrueAI cannot interact with images or files sent in messages.

If you need more help after using TrueAI, we encourage you to open a support ticket. Our team is ready to assist you.

We hope TrueAI will be a valuable resource for you all. Wishing everyone a happy and successful 2024!
