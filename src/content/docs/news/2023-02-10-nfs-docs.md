At TrueCharts, we are always striving to make our platform more accessible and user-friendly. That's why we are excited to announce the release of our comprehensive guide on using NFS shares to bypass TrueNAS SCALE hostPath validation.

Many of our users have expressed concern about this issue and we are happy to provide a clear and easy-to-follow solution. Our guide covers all the necessary steps to set up NFS shares from scratch and directly mount them with our apps. With just a few minutes of work, you'll be able to use NFS shares to bypass the hostPath validation issues that have been causing headaches for many of our users.

We hope this guide will provide our users with a clear and straightforward solution to this issue. You can access the [full guide here](/deprecated/scale/guides/nfs-share).

At TrueCharts, we are always working to improve our platform and provide the best possible user experience. With this guide, we hope to achieve just that!
