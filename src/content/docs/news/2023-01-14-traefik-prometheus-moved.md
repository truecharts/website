We're started the process of moving some more of the core parts of TrueCharts to our Enterprise train. These Apps are important for most of our users and should get the priority treatment the Enterprise Train is known for.
This also means users would be required to reinstall these Apps and they will not be available in the stable train anymore. We're sorry for the added inconvenience, but we're quite certain that this choice is going to serve our users best in the long term.

Our plans for the Enterprise train are still going strong:

When we deem TrueNAS SCALE Apps "ready for production use", the Enterprise train will come with Paid support and much additional documentation for each of its Apps. Until that time, it will still be "just another train" and will contain Apps that are very important to the TrueCharts project as a whole.
