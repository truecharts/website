After building our own MetalLB operator chart, we've also now finished the work on building our own CloudNative-PG Chart.
As of today this chart will be a requirement for new users if they want to run applications featuring a postgresql database.

**Updating to the new Cloudnative-PG helm chart for existing users**

We want to point out though, that users should update the new CloudNative-PG Helm chart _as soon as possible_.
To update an existing install with applications using postgresql databases to the new system, the following procedure can be used:

We want to explicitly highlight that this procedure _will_ **COMPLETELY DESTROY** all your databases.
It's absolutely crucial to export your databases manually beforehand.

- export all your databases manually, on SCALE using the [following guide](/deprecated/scale/guides/cnpg-migration-guide) (do **not** rely on heavyscript backups for this!)
- run this in a **root** shell: `k3s kubectl delete  --grace-period 30 --v=4 -k https://github.com/truecharts/manifests/delete2`
- install the new `cloudnative-pg` chart from the `operators` train
- wait a few minutes
- Hit `edit` and save without changes on all applications using postgresql databases.
- wait a few minutes
- Restore all your databases manually, on SCALE using the [following guide](/deprecated/scale/guides/cnpg-migration-guide) (do **not** rely on heavyscript backups for this!)
