title: Setting Up an S3 Storage Provider
---

The below outlines how to setup an S3 storage provider for use with TrueCharts. 

## S3 Backup Providers

Our only officially supported system for "offsite" backups is S3(-compatible) storage. Offsite can be either another machine with running [MinIO](https://min.io/) or a S3 Storage provider like [BackBlaze](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-s3-compatible-api), [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/developer-platform/r2/), [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (coming soon) and more. Currently our only *officially* supported backup providers are CloudFlare and BackBlaze, but we're working to expand this list in the future.

Both CloudFlare and BackBlaze provide a free plan with 10GB of storage included.

## Obtaining S3 credentials

### CloudFlare

1. Login into your CloudFlare account and go to the R2 section seen below, you might need to agree to the Terms for the R2 Storage
