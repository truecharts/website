## Remove Old CNPG

1. Run the following command in system shell as root.

```bash
k3s kubectl delete --grace-period 30 --v=4 -k https://github.com/truecharts/manifests/delete2
```

## Install cloudnative-pg

1. Install cloudnative-pg from the system train, wait for it to go ACTIVE.

## Prepare CNPG Apps

1. Edit the app config of the CNPG application (home assistant in this example) and save the configuration without making any changes.

2. Wait for all pods to be created and app to be Active. This may take a few minutes. In this example Home Assistant will show ACTIVE 3/3 when its ready.

3. Get the name of the app deploy.

```bash
k3s kubectl get deploy -n ix-<app>
```

4. Stop the main pod of the app you are migrating.

```bash
k3s kubectl scale deploy <app> -n ix-<app> --replicas=0
```
