## TrueCharts on Helm

TrueCharts aims to always support the latest version of Helm.
However, sometimes new versions of either TrueNAS or TrueCharts introduces breaking changes.
This document highlights which versions of TrueCharts (or rather branches), support which versions of Helm.

We also document which versions of TrueNAS will receive TrueCharts updates and for which versions we are accepting bug reports.

### Supported Versions of Helm

| TrueNAS version | Branch   | Supported with updates | Accepting Support tickets | Accepting Bug Reports | Notes |
