## TrueCharts on FluxCD

TrueCharts aims to always support the latest version of FluxCD.
However, sometimes new versions of either TrueNAS or TrueCharts introduces breaking changes.
This document highlights which versions of TrueCharts (or rather branches), support which versions of FluxCD.

We also document which versions of TrueNAS will receive TrueCharts updates and for which versions we are accepting bug reports.
